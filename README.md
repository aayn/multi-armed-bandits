# Multi-armed Bandits: 10-armed Testbed

Based on the 10-armed testbed as described in chapter 2 of the textbook,
Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto
(2nd edition). The testbed, all the algorithms of the chapter, and the two programming
exercises are there in this repository.

The code has been tested with Python 3, though it could also work with Python 2
with some minor tweaks.
